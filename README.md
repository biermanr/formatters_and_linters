Code and slides to introduce the concept of formatters, linters, and pre-commit, specifically using `black` and `ruff`.
Slides are in this directory at `presentation/fmt_lint_precommit.pdf` and were created with [presenterm](https://github.com/mfontanini/presenterm).
The presentation can be run in a terminal with `cd presentation && sh present.sh` after cloning and installing presenterm.
